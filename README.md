## Features

### Hidden Ability Chance

Whenever a Pokémon spawns, there is a chance that it can have its hidden ability slot unlocked. Many Pokémon have a hidden ability, and various generations of the main games have provided different ways to get Pokémon that have their hidden ability slot unlocked.

### Config Options

In the config, you can choose a simple flat chance for all wild spawning Pokémon to unlock their hidden ability. By default, it’s 1 chance in 10, which comes out to 10%.
